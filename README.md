Hello There !


This program check Mouse events and do some entity
movement. Code is fresh and kept updated regularly
or more often. Current I am working on the map and
wish to implement some sort of pathfinding.

After or meanwhile will work on buildings and 
diversity of creatures and game logic and actions
for player, maybe Hero and Mob style game.

Move mouse, select or drag and use right click to 
order characters, so far... 

Left click - select and deselect and apply build
Left click + drag - select multiple unit

Right click - add new goal to unit

if not valid goal, unit generates new random goal.
